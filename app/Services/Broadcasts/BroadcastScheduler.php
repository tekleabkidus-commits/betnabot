/**
 * Runs every minute from the Laravel scheduler (spec §7): promotes due
 * one-off scheduled broadcasts, and for recurring definitions materializes a
 * one-off child occurrence and advances the parent (spec §4.3).
 *
 * HARDENING §6 concurrency: one-off promotion was always race-safe (the
 * atomic status claim in BroadcastLifecycle::start). Recurring
 * materialization now runs inside a transaction with the parent row locked
 * (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) and a due re-check, and each occurrence is
 * identified by (parent_broadcast_id, occurrence_at) under a unique index —
 * database-level idempotency even if application locking ever fails.
